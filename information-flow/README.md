# Online Auction Solutions (OAS)

## Scope

Online Auction Solutions A/S (OAS) is designed to bridge the gap between traditional auction practices and the digital world, providing small auction houses with a secure and comprehensive online bidding system. The project targets the enhancement of auction processes with an emphasis on security, transparency, and accessibility.

### Key Features

- **Commission Bids**: Enabling participants to place commission bids where the system automatically bids up to a predetermined maximum on their behalf, ensuring their competitive presence without real-time participation.

- **Security and Transparency**: With the adoption of a decentralized information flow control framework by Myers and Liskov, OAS commits to high security standards. The system is delivered with a clear information flow policy, security labels on all program variables, and proofs of adherence to these security protocols, ensuring the integrity of auction operations.

- **Reputation System**: Incorporating a reputation system that assigns bidding limits based on the bidder's history and credibility. New users face initial limits which can be expanded based on their auction history or references from reputable sources, thus maintaining a trustworthy bidding environment.

The project emphasizes the development of a conceptual mockup focusing on the backend logic and security model rather than UI/UX design or specific security protocols. It is tailored for flexibility, with inputs and outputs managed through program variables, function parameters, or command-line arguments, making it adaptable to various auction house needs.

OAS is committed to delivering a high-quality, securely modeled system that prioritizes core functionalities and data integrity over an extensive feature set. Developed for compatibility with Java and Python, it ensures accessibility and ease of integration for auction houses aiming to extend their reach into the online domain.
